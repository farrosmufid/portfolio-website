                                <p>Started studying for a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Indonesia, 
                                    where I took courses such as Introduction to Programming, Statistics, Numerical Computations, 
                                    Signals and Systems, Electronic Circuits, and many more. I continued my studies for a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering
                                    in July 2017 at the University of Sydney, where I took courses such as Computer Architecture, Thesis A, and Thesis B.

                                <p>I helped with Telkomsel's three-year Data Migration project (2017-2020),
                                    transitioning from Oracle ERP to SAP S/4 HANA by developing 
                                    SQL queries and data service functions for eight fund management data objects, 
                                    ensuring smooth data extraction in line with the functional team's specifications.</p>

                                <p>I continued studying Computer Science and IT to broaden my knowledge in Software Engineering, 
                                    UI/UX Design, Data Science, and Data Analytics.

                                <p>I completed a capstone project focused on developing an interactive dashboard web application with Plotly Dash, 
                                    designed to monitor antibiotic resistance among Westmead Hospital patients. 
                                    In this project, I took on multiple roles, including that of a Front End Developer, 
                                    Data Analyst, and Data Scientist. As a Data Scientist, I used linear regression with time series 
                                    to forecast trends in Drug-Associated Susceptibility Changes (DASC) for various antibiotics.
                                    As a Front End Developer, I iterated the front-end UI design four times to enhance the UX based on the client's functional criteria.
                                    The client was satisfied with the results, achieving an HD grade.</p>
